## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the github for CyberStudents UK! Here you will be able to find all of our projects we are currently working on. 

**What are we and what do we do?**

Well, I am glad to say we aim to provide students an opportunity to grow within not only the IT and Developer sector but also allow them to connect and network with one another. 

**Can I join?**\
Yes! Anyone is welcome to join, if you would like to enquire more, please feel free to reach out to us at membership@cyberstudents.live

**Found a vulnerability?** \
If you have found a vulnerability in any of our projects, please do not keep quiet! Report it to us at security@cyberstudents.live so that we can fix it.
